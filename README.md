Forgot to create until halfway through

Mission Demolition a.k.a scuffed Angry Birds
Game runs exactly as instructed in the book, except for a few slight adjustments.
As instructed I added 3 of the proposed extensions in the high score per castle, different castle materials, and (i think) a parallax background.
When I looked up definitions for parallax backgrounds with examples all I found were things that look like what I made, but can accept if I missed the mark.

Other than that I once again added an Intro scene, because I think it just makes "Mission Demolition" feel more like a real game. 
The "How to Play" scene also made an appearance, because sometimes people just need a little help to get the projectile floatin'.

I also added two addition buttons, one to stop the endless loop that is "Mission Demolition", and one to reset the current level.
Sometimes the castle just falls in the worst possible way and makes hitting the goal zone extremely tedious, so the reset button is nice. 

After seeing Mr. Rowan's submission however I can't really in good conscience say any of my extra additions deserve extra credit.
